Headphones Website - ALX HTML/CSS Project

Project Overview
This project implements a fully functional and responsive marketing website for "Headphones," based on a provided design blueprint. The primary goal is to demonstrate a solid understanding and application of fundamental HTML, CSS, and responsive design principles, ensuring the web page looks identical to the designer file across various screen sizes.

This project was built from scratch without the use of any external CSS frameworks or JavaScript, focusing purely on core web development skills.

Design Reference
The visual design and specifications for this website are derived from the Figma design file. Developers should refer to this for exact measurements, typography, colors, and layout.

Features Implemented
Responsive Layout: Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, with a dedicated mobile version for screens 480px wide or less.

Hero Section: Prominent header with a background image, clear navigation, main title, sub-title, and a call-to-action button, followed by a descriptive paragraph.

"What we do" Section: Showcases key features/services with icons, titles, and descriptions arranged in a responsive grid.

"Our results" Section: Highlights achievements with percentage-based visuals and accompanying text, presented on a dark background.

Contact Us Section: A basic form for user inquiries.

F.A.Q Section: Displays frequently asked questions and answers in a two-column responsive layout.

Interactive Elements: Implements specified hover and active states for navigation links and buttons.

Semantic HTML5: Uses appropriate HTML tags to ensure a well-structured and accessible document.

Custom CSS: All styling is achieved using vanilla CSS, without relying on external frameworks.

Requirements Adherence
No External CSS Frameworks: All styling is custom-written.

Figma Usage: Design accuracy is paramount, referencing the provided Figma PDF for dimensions, colors, and fonts.

Font Handling: Uses Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle OT (or suitable fallbacks/imports).

Interactions:

Links hover/active: Color changes to #FF6565.
